# plot_erp
plot_erp is a MATLAB-based script to plot event-related potentials (ERPs) from any number of given epoched datasets (in EEGLAB format), for a single channel. For each ERP curve, any number of datasets can be given. It can optionally calculate and plot a difference wave, standard errors, and permutation-based statistics (using [permutationTest](https://github.com/lrkrol/permutationTest)). Mean curves and statistics can be calculated either within or between datasets.

Sample screenshots:

Two ERPs plus their difference, standard error of the mean for all curves, and statistics highlighting significant differences in grey.

ERPs for eight groups of 19 datasets each with custom colour code, labels, and x scale indicator position.
